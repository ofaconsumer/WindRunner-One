# Windrunner One
## An open-source L3 rockoon heading for space.

WindRunner One is a conceptual rockoon that during simulations achieves a balloon-assisted apogee of ~160km above Earth without payload.
Using a 1.5kg payload gets up to an altitude of ~120km, with an estimated price (not including the HA balloon rental). Compare that to the average sounding rocket cost of $10-20k, and if you include the balloon rental in there you're getting a fraction of the cost for a similar trajectory.
