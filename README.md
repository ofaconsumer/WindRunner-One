# Windrunner One
## An open-source L3 rockoon heading for space.

WindRunner One is a conceptual rockoon that during simulations achieves a balloon-assisted apogee of ~160km above Earth.*

_1. The apogee is without any payload installed on the rocket. Changes to the apogee may apply when adding payloads, e.g. flight computer, altimeter, etc._
